# Peformancebyhour
Since I couldn't track all the deliveries and tips made during a specific hour, I tried to discern it from the schedule using this approach:
I grouped *all* the days I was working during a specific hour, I summed up all the deliveries and tips done in those entire days and I calculated the delivery/hour and tips/delivery ratios.

Example: At '17.30' I was working for a total of 186 times. Considering all those 186 working days I was earning 3717€ of tips and I was doing 3023 deliveries. The avarage Tip/Delivery ratio at '17.30' is 1.22€/delivery.
I iterated this for every 30 minutes of a day.

It is a very conservative approach since the result will be a huge avarage of very different days, although it is a statistical relevant as for each block since for each 30 minutes block we have more than hundred counts representing working days.
